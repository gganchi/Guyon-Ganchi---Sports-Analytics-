# About Me
Hello, my name is Guyon Ganchi and I am currently a student at IU Indianapolis studying sports analytics. While I specialize in basketball, specifically the NBA, I'm also familiar with other sports and am always willing to learn more and diversify my technical skill set. I currently work with the IU Indy women's basketball team (D1), providing the team with analytical insights ranging from team (offensive and defensive rating calculations) and individual performance (box plus/minus) to opponent scouting using Synergy, an analytics platform that has statistical and video breakdown of every possession in college basketball games.

# Projects Worked on:
- 2025-26 NBA MVP Prediction: Developed a predictive model (XGBoost) that outputs a .csv file displaying the odds of a NBA player winning the 2025-26 NBA MVP as of 11/28/25.
- Salary Determination of a NBA Free Agent: Created a logistic regression model to predict a NBA free agent's salary based on the 2017 NBA collective bargaining agreement (done in 2020).
